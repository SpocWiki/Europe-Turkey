After [[../../../../../Time-Ages/geo~Eons/Eon~4~Phanerozoic/Era~3~Cenozoic/Period~3~Quaternary/Epoch~3~Anthropocene/Modern_History/CE_1900/1914-World_War_I|World War I]], the [[../../../../../Time-Ages/geo~Eons/Eon~4~Phanerozoic/Era~3~Cenozoic/Period~3~Quaternary/Epoch~2~Holocene/7750-Meghalayan/Middle_Ages/1300-Late_Middle-Ages/CE_1300/1300-Ottoman_Empire-1922|Ottoman Empire]] was dissolved into many States like Iraq, Syria, Palestine etc. 
Turkish Nationalists around [[../../../../../Society/Politics/Government/Leader/Modern_Leaders/Atatürk,Mustafa_Kemal|Atatürk]] reformed and modernized Turkey, 
picking Structures and Laws from different European Countries and introducing [[Laicism]]. 
The previous [[../../../../../Philosophy/Metaphysic/Religion/Abrahamic_Religion/Islam/Ummah|Ummah]] Community was replaced by a national Identity, 
which was also enforced by suppressing or relocating minor Ethnicities like 
[[../../../Asia/Asia~West/Jewish_People|Jews]], [[Alawites]] and [[Kurds]]. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The history of the area now forming the territory of the Republic of Turkey, 
> includes the history of both Anatolia (the Asian part of Turkey) 
> and Eastern Thrace (the European part of Turkey). 
> 
> These two previously politically distinct regions 
> came under control of the Roman Empire in the second century BC, 
> eventually becoming the core of the Roman Byzantine Empire. 
> 
> For times predating the Ottoman period, a distinction should also be made 
> between the history of the Turkic peoples, 
> and the history of the territories now forming the Republic of Turkey. 
> 
> The history of Turkey spans the medieval history of the Seljuk Empire, 
> the medieval to modern history of the Ottoman Empire, 
> and the history of the Republic of Turkey since the 1920s.
