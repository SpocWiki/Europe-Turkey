> The history of Turkey, 
> understood as the history of the area now forming the territory of the Republic of Turkey, 
> includes the history of both Anatolia (the Asian part of Turkey) 
> and Eastern Thrace (the European part of Turkey). 
> 
> These two previously politically distinct regions 
> came under control of the Roman Empire in the second century BC, 
> eventually becoming the core of the Roman Byzantine Empire. 
> 
> For times predating the Ottoman period, a distinction should also be made between the history of the Turkic peoples, and the history of the territories now forming the Republic of Turkey From the time when parts of what is now Turkey were conquered by the Seljuq dynasty, the history of Turkey spans the medieval history of the Seljuk Empire, the medieval to modern history of the Ottoman Empire, and the history of the Republic of Turkey since the 1920s.
