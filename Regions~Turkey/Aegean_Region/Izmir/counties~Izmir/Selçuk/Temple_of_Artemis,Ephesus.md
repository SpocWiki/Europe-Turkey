> The **Temple of Artemis** or Artemision (Greek: Ἀρτεμίσιον; Turkish: Artemis Tapınağı), 
> also known as the Temple of Diana, 
> was a Greek temple dedicated to a localised form of the goddess Artemis 
> (equated with the Roman goddess Diana). 
> 
> It was located in Ephesus, near modern day Selçuk in Turkey). 
> While it had been destroyed and rebuilt many times in ancient history, 
> the last incarnation of the temple was destroyed in 401 CE. 
> Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain in the present day.
>
> The beginning of the history of the temple is unclear. 
> It is known, however, 
> that the earliest version of the temple was destroyed by a flood in the 7th century BCE. 
> 
> A more elaborate reconstruction of the temple began around 550 BCE 
> under the leadership of the Greek architect from Crete Chersiphron, 
> funded by Croesus of Lydia. 
> 
> This version of the temple lasted until 356 BCE, 
> when it was burned down by an arsonist, popularly identified as Herostratus.
>
> The final form of the temple was funded by the people of Ephesus. 
> The temple was central to Ephesian life, 
> as it had great political and social value to its citizens. 
> 
> The Ephesian Artemis, 
> which was considered as separate from the Hellenic version of the god, 
> had very unique features and artifacts associated with her 
> and was seen as a protector of the city.
