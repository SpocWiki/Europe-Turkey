> **Troy** (Hittite: 𒆳𒌷𒋫𒊒𒄿𒊭, romanised: Truwiša/Taruiša; Ancient Greek: Τροία, 
> romanised: Troíā; Latin: Troia) or Ilion (Hittite: 𒌷𒃾𒇻𒊭, romanised: Wiluša; 
> Ancient Greek: Ἴλιον, romanised: Ī́lion) 
> was an ancient city located in present-day Hisarlik, Turkey. 
> 
> It is best known as the setting for the Greek myth of the Trojan War. 
> The archaeological site is open to the public as a tourist destination, 
> and was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1998.
>
> Troy was repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt during its 4000 years of occupation. 
> As a result, the site is divided into nine archaeological layers, each corresponding to a city built on the ruins of the previous. Archaeologists refer to these layers using Roman numerals, Troy I being the earliest and Troy IX being the latest. 
>
> Troy was first settled around 3600 BC and grew into a small fortified city around 3000 BC (Troy I). Among the early layers, Troy II is notable for its wealth and imposing architecture. During the Late Bronze Age, Troy was called Wilusa and was a vassal of the Hittite Empire. The final layers (Troy VIII–IX) were Greek and Roman cities which served as tourist attractions and religious centers because of their link to mythic tradition.
>
> The site was excavated by Heinrich Schliemann and Frank Calvert starting in 1871. Under the ruins of the classical city, they found the remains of numerous earlier settlements. Several of these layers resemble literary depictions of Troy, leading some scholars to conclude that there is a kernel of truth underlying the legends. Subsequent excavations by others have added to the modern understanding of the site, though the exact relationship between myth and reality remains unclear and there is no definitive evidence for a Greek attack on the city.
