> (Etimesgut, Yenimahalle, Çankaya, Keçiören, Altındağ, Pursaklar, Mamak, Gölbaşı, Sincan) 
> and 5,864,049 in Ankara Province (total of 25 districts). 
> Ankara is Turkey's second-largest city by population after Istanbul, 
> first by urban land area, and third by metro land area after Konya and Sivas.
>
> Ankara was historically known as Ancyra and Angora. 
> Serving as the capital of the ancient Celtic state of Galatia (280–64 BC), 
> and later of the Roman province with the same name (25 BC–7th century), Ankara has various 
> Hattian, Hittite, Lydian, Phrygian, Galatian, Greek, Persian, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman archeological sites. 
> 
> The Ottomans made the city the capital first of the Anatolia Eyalet (1393 – late 15th century) 
> and then the Angora Eyalet (1827–1864) and the Angora Vilayet (1867–1922). 
> 
> On 23 April 1920, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey was established in Ankara, 
> which became the headquarters of the Turkish National Movement during the Turkish War of Independence. 
> Ankara became the new Turkish capital upon the establishment of the Republic on 29 October 1923, 
> succeeding in this role as the former Turkish capital Istanbul following the fall of the Ottoman Empire. 
>
> The historical center of Ankara is a rocky hill rising 150 m (500 ft) over the left bank of the Ankara River, a tributary of the Sakarya River. The hill remains crowned by the ruins of Ankara Castle. Although few of its outworks have survived, there are well-preserved examples of Roman and Ottoman architecture throughout the city.

> The government is a prominent employer, but Ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city located at the center of Turkey's road and railway networks. The city gave its name to the Angora wool shorn from Angora rabbits, the long-haired Angora goat (the source of mohair), and the Angora cat. The area is also known for its pears, honey and Muscat grapes. Although situated in one of the driest regions of Turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation (except for the forested areas on the southern periphery), Ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant, at 72 square meters (775 square feet) per head. Home to numerous universities, Ankara is among the top 100 science and technology clusters in the world.
